          The DCS employs multiple autonomous controllers, each housing its own
          processor, which distribute across the system to automate processes
          effectively. If a processor fails, it impacts only one section of the
          plant process, unlike a central computer failure that could disrupt
          the entire process.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          As the 'central brain' of the plant, the DCS makes automated decisions
          based on real-time production trends observed throughout the plant. In
          contrast to a PLC, which adjusts a single unit operation, the DCS can
          fine-tune each of a plantâ€™s many interacting unit operations.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          With a centralized network of computers, the DCS coordinates
          adjustments across the plant, feeding instructions to individual
          controllers. This advanced system reduces downtime, enhances
          production efficiency, and maintains compliance with safety standards.
