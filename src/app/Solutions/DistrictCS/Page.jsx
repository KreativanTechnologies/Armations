      description: "Air handling units condition and distribute air throughout a building with Energy Saving Solution â€“ Aarmation Electric. First, they draw fresh ambient air from outside and then clean it. Next, they either heat or cool the air and may add humidity as needed. Subsequently, the system forces this conditioned air through ductwork to designated areas within the building. Additionally, most units include a separate duct to remove used, dirty air from rooms, which is then returned to the AHU. A fan in the AHU discharges this air back to the atmosphere. Furthermore, some of this return air gets recirculated into the fresh air supply to conserve energy.",
